			"explanations": {
				"a": "We rearrange the equation for shear strength to solve for θ as: Angle of internal friction, θ = tan<sup>-1</sup>(S / σ). We ignore C as it is 0.",
				"b": "We rearrange the equation for shear strength to solve for θ as: Angle of internal friction, θ = tan<sup>-1</sup>(S / σ). We ignore C as it is 0.",
